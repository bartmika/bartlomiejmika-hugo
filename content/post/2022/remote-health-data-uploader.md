Submit your HealthKit data to a remote server.

<!--more-->

If you are a programmer and you are looking to export your health data (stored in HealthKit) then this application is for you!

You simply build the API server you want, self host it and use **Remote Health Data Uploader** app to send data from your iPhone to your server!

This app does not collect any of your private data either!

If you have any questions and would like to make suggestions, please email me. My contact information is found below.
