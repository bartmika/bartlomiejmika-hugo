Welcome to my first blog post, I'll explain the purpose of this site, why I started it, and what I hope to accomplish.

<!--more-->

# Hello and welcome!

My name is Bartlomiej Mika, I am a technical consultant at [Mika Software Corporation] and welcome to my first blog post.

I am a big fan of reading [Hacker News]() for my tech news but recently an article titled ["Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://archive.is/xbFqF) has inspired me to create this blog!

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is as follows.

### 1.  Share Knowledge
As I learn new things I want to share the lessons learned.

 ### 2. Centralize Content
Over the years I have written various articles across different websites but always scattered across the web; sometimes the content written gets lost over time  for various reasons such as:

* Site owners delete data
* Sites lose data
* Sites shutdown
* Content gets "curated" out

As a result, this site will be that single location to centralize my content and make it easy-to-find for users.

## 3. Improve Technical Communication
I want to improve my technical communication writing articles.

### 4. Personalized Site
I miss the old world wide web that I remember in the '90s. I miss the creativity, the ingenuity, and quirkiness of personal websites that you would typically find from individuals before giant websites like [Facebook](https://facebook.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com) came along. In a sense, I hope this website could be an interesting place.

## Expected Topics
What sort of topics should you expect?

* Programming

* Open-Source Libraries

* Tutorials

* My Projects

* Personal thoughts about various topics and subjects

Thank you for visiting and please don't forget to bookmark this site.
