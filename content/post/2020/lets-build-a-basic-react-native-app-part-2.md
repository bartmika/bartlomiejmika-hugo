Continuing from [part 1](/posts/2020/08/28/lets-build-a-basic-react-native-app-part-1/) of our series for creating our React Native app called **"Garbage Day"**, let's learn how to add our core components, actions and styles.

Before we start building, let's make sure we are on the same page with our understanding.

* You have followed along from our [first post](/posts/2020/08/28/lets-build-a-basic-react-native-app-part-1/)

Our home page does not have any core functionality which we've detailed in our **design**, nor has our settings page, how can we implement?

In React (Web) we would begin by writing custom components utilizing props, states and functions, but how about React Native (RN)? In RN we would almost do the same - however with some difference! According to the [Learn the Basics](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial#) article (please read it), here are some notes:

* React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks
* The ``Text`` component allows us to render a text, while the ``View`` component renders a container
