The purpose of this post is to provide instructions on how to setup a simple RESTful API server, in Golang, using only the [*net/http* package](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) and not any other third-party web framework. You will learn how to create REST endpoints within your project that can handle **POST**, **GET**, **PUT** and **DELETE** HTTP requests. This is the first post in a multi-post series.
