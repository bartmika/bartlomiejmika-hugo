(Date: 2021-03-19)

Into the over world from the underworld! The mulberries were grown in the basement for the majority of their existence and now are able to live in the outside for the first time. In this [grow journal](/tags/grow-journal/) I'll write about my experience bring the red mulberries into the outside and growing them over summer.

## Winter Strikes Back
Disaster strikes! The mulberries were taken outside a little too early as winter strikes back and covers them with snow for a few days. I wasn't able to do anything but helpless watch.

## The Return of Spring
Thankfully the mulberries recovered and began to thrive. Here we have a dragonfly stopped by for a rest.
