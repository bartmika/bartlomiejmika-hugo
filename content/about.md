Salutations! Welcome to my personal blog.

My name is Bartlomiej Mika, I am a technical consultant at [Mika Software Corporation](https://mikasoftware.com). This blog began in 2020 primarily as an outlet for technical, programming-related posts. I want to a place to document some of the things I am learning and release it to the public in hopes to save someone else the time.

What sort of topics should you expect?

* Programming

* Open-Source Libraries

* Tutorials

* My Projects

* Personal thoughts about various topics and subjects
