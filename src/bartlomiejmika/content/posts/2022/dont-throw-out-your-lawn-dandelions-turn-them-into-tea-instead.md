In this post, I'll talk about a clever [#ZeroWaste hack](/tags/zero-waste/) that recently got me thinking: *turning annoying dandelions into yummy tea!* In this article I'd like to share what I learned and my experience thus far.

# Disclaimer

Whenever dealing with wild edibles, please consult an expert and or read material to confirm identity of the plant before doing anything. There are dangerous edibles and you need to be careful. Furthermore some plants interact with medication you are taking and or health condition you currently have; as a result, you'll need to do your research! Proceed at your own risk!

In addition, if your lawn has been sprayed with pesticides or any chemicals at any point in the history of your property then you cannot continue as it will be a hazard to your health.

# Let's Begin...
It's a sunny afternoon, you finally have time to mow the backyard after finishing an intensive week of computer programming. Before you begin, you realize you'r backyard is full of *dandelions* that must be pulled out before you begin your mowing. *Yikes!*

So you get your *weed puller* and proceed with picking all the dandelions out. Wow, some of the dandelions have huge roots! The hours goes by and you may see something like this by the end:

*Photo: The annoying dandelions you pulled*

So you are finished, you are about to put the annoying dandelions into a tras...

# STOP, don't throw those out!

You can do other things with those dandelions. Here is a list of things you can do:

* Make tea from the roots.

* Use the leaves as mulch for other plants in your garden.

* Add the yellow flower to the salad you regularly eat.

* Add the leaves to the salad you regularly eat.

Pretty cool huh? Betcha' you didn't know this? And truth is neither did I until I started learning about [wild edibles](/tags/wild-edibles/). For the purposes of this article, I'll just talk about the tea making aspect. By no means am I an expert on this, I am just simply writing down what I learned from researching.

# Why do I have so many dandelions in my backyard to begin with?

Before we begin, let's get some theory out of the way. The most important rule you need to memorize is this:

> Nature abhors barren soil, it tries to **fill it with life**

And how does nature do this? With **succession**, it goes as follows:

* Barren land gets filled with *weeds* and *annuals* (plants that can only grow only for one year) whom can withstand the terribly harsh environment.
* Once the weeds and annuals are established, they work to *improve the soil* (also can say *pioneer*) for their descendants. Soil improvement happens when the dead leaves fall onto the top of the soil increasing the organic content; furthermore, the roots in the soil help soil life grow which in turn supports the plants in the future.
* The conditions continue to improve until bigger weeds and annuals can take root.
* Bigger weeds and annuals makes the soil condition suitable for *perennials* (plants that can grow for more then one year) to root.
* Perennials can live longer and thus provider greater *soil improvements* by having deeper roots to support soil life / mine soil minerals and provide organic matter on the surface of the soil (ex: dead leaves). For example, the plant [comfery]() can have roots several meters in the ground!
* Fast forward the process and trees enter the scene...
* Small trees become established which pioneer the environment for medium sized trees to be supported.
* Medium sized trees pioneer the environment for large sized trees.
* ... The barren land is now an abundant forest.

You can now see how a green lawn plays into the **succession** lifecycle and hence why it would be susceptible to dandelions. But why are there *so many dandelions* in my backyard?

The next theory to get out of the way is that:

> Every plant/tree have **special functions** to the ecosystem.

Here are some functions:

* **Fixes nitrogen into soil** - Plants/trees in this category have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria in their roots that allows excess nitrogen fixation. They are best suited for soils with low nitrogen. Examples: Clover, beans, black locust tree, etc.
* **Mine minerals from earth** - Plant/trees in this category extract more minerals then usual due to their long roots and or root extracting focus; furthermore, they decompact the hard soil into loser and easier soil. They are best suited for hard compact soils with low mineral content. Examples: Comfery, dandelions, maple trees, etc.
* **Attract pollinator insects** - Plants/trees specialized in attracting insects that pollinate their flowers resulting in more disperse genetics and more abundant seeds. The pollinator insects benefit every plant/tree around them. They are best suited for environments with lots of fruit plants/trees nearby. Examples: Tulips, Hydrangeas, etc.
* **Produce food for insects / mammals** - Plants/trees in this category are able to spread farther distances and colonize more land faster thanks to the insects / mammals that eat the fruit and excrete the seed. They are best suited for environments which need to support lots of insect / mammal life. Examples: Blueberries, Apple Trees, Oak Trees, etc.
* **Stabilizes soil** - Plant/trees in this category are able to prevent soil erosion / slides / etc which in turn allow other plants to establish and thrive. These are best suited in hill sides, water areas, etc. Examples: Oak trees, Pine Trees, etc.
* **Windbreaker** - Plants/trees in this category can withstand hostile / destructive wind to stabilize the environment around them to make it possible for other plants/trees survive given the extreme wind. They are best suited in large open fields, near ocean sides, etc. Examples: Pine trees.

The combination of different plant/trees with different functions allows nature to symbiotically / synergistically in converting barren land into full potential of the environment given the limitations. Example: temperate forest, desert oasis, rainforest, taiga, etc.

Given all the above, you can now begin to understand that your soil is too compact and / or missing certain minerals which encourages so many dandelions to grow and pioneer the soil. If any of this interests you then please do some research on **permaculture**.

# Why should I drink dandelion tea?
If you plan on eating dandelions, it's good to know what you're getting yourself into. Here's a quick video explaining the *health benefits*. That's right, you read it correctly, a pesky weed in your lawn turns out to be beneficial to your health!

# How do you make dandelion tea?
If you plan to actually go ahead and try making tea, it's good to see how other people do it. This was the first video I watched in a chain of videos and I recommend you watch it.

# How did I make dandelion tea?
So here goes, this is how I did it ...

We can make dandelion tea with the roots of the plant. So the first thing to do is start by removing all the leaves and collect the roots.

![Remove leaves](/img/2022/07/09/2.jpg)

When you are finished, you'll have two piles: (1) Leaves (2) Roots.

![Two piles: (1) Leaves (2) Roots](/img/2022/07/09/3.jpg)

Let's dump the leaves into the garden so when they breakdown, the minerals in the leaves will be added my garden. In this picture I am adding the leaves to a lovely *swamp oak tree* I am growing in a pot.

Next take the roots and begin washing off all the dirt. If you are able, use a scrubber to remove as much dirt as possible.

When you finish cleaning the roots, they'll look approximately similar like this photo.
![Washed dandelion roots](/img/2022/07/09/7.jpg)

Afterwords place the washed roots onto some-sort of oven pan.
![dandelion roots in oven pan](/img/2022/07/09/8.jpg)

Insert the pan into an oven and cook for 30 minutes on 350 degrees. <TODO CONFIRM>

When you finish you'll see something like this after.
![dandelion roots cooked by oven](/img/2022/07/09/10.jpg)

Take the cooked roots and cut them into little tiny pieces.
![cut dandelion roots into small pieces](/img/2022/07/09/11.jpg)

Once the roots are cut into tiny pieces, put them in a storage container like a jar or pot. You can now drink dandelion anytime in the future.

And finally you're ready to take a refreshing dring. Just put in a few roots into a boiling cup of water, let it simmer and you can drink.

Cheers!

# Before you go...

To continue with the theme of [#ZeroWaste hacks](/tags/zero-waste/) for your garden. Do some research on the following:

* Can I do anything with burdock?
* Can I do anything with stinging nettles?
* Can I do anything with red clover flowers?
* Can I do anything with ginko balbo leaves?
