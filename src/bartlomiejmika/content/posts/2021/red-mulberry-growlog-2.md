How are the mulberries growing? In this growlog I show you the growth from seed to seedling and detail some of my challenges.

## Germination
The red mulberries planted previously had successfully germinated. Here is one of the container showing growth.

## Gemination Expansion
As the mulberries become crowded, I translplanted a few of them into the following containers.

## Subterranean Relocation

As the seed germination continued, more and more space was required to house their containers; as a result, all the mulberries were moved to the basement. This move was a relief to us as our kitchen space was again free for our use.

Please note, a few other trees are in this picture which was planted separately:

* Columnar English Oak
* Unspecified White Oak (Could be English, White, Bur?)
* Avocado
* Honey Locust
* Black Locust

## IoT Experimentation

In the [past](https://github.com/mikaponics) I've experimented with writing software for sensor data collection. You can see the code via:

* [mikapod-storage](https://github.com/mikaponics/mikapod-storage)
* [mikapod-soil-arduino](https://github.com/mikaponics/mikapod-soil-arduino)
* [mikapod-soil-reader](https://github.com/mikaponics/mikapod-soil-reader)
* [mikapod-soil-poller](https://github.com/mikaponics/mikapod-soil-poller)
* [mikapod-soil-remote](https://github.com/mikaponics/mikapod-soil-remote)

Here are the pictures with the device.

## Growth

Honestly, this is an exiting development! The winter is cold outside, but inside the basement (~18 degrees Celsius) the sea of green leaves brings much relaxation.

## Major Expansion + Growth

This is my favourite picture as it does a good job showing all the greenery that my family had a chance to enjoy during the cold and grey days of winter.

And there it is - major growth and expansion. Stay toned to the next grow journal were I placed the mulberries outside! If you want to read about other trees/plants then feel free to checkout my [grow journals](/tags/grow-journal/).

Has this peeked your curiosity about doing your own growing? Have you tried growing before? Is there anything I could do to improve? Let me know in the comments below.
